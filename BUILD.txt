To create a Makefile you need Premake.

 - Getting Premake

If you donâ€™t have Premake already, download it now http://premake.sourceforge.net/download

Premake is a small (around 150K) command-line executable. Unpack it and put it on your system search path or anywhere convenient.

 - Using Premake

The simplest Premake command is

$ premake --target toolset
Where toolset is one of:

vs2008	 Visual Studio 2008 (experimental)
vs2005	 Visual Studio 2005 (or Express)
vs2003	 Visual Studio 2003
vs2002	 Visual Studio 2002
vs6	     Visual Studio 6
gnu	     GNU Make makefiles
sharpdev SharpDevelop
monodev	 MonoDevelop
cb-gcc	 Code::Blocks with GCC
cb-ow	 Code::Blocks with Open Watcom C/C++
cl-gcc	 CodeLite with GCC

You can see a complete list of options by typing

$ premake --help
In addition to the built-in options, your software project may also have one or more custom options; these will be displayed at the end of the list. You can specify options by listing them before the target, like this:

$ premake --dotnet mono2 --target gnu
If at some point you decide that you would like to remove all of the project files and intermediate objects and start again, you can use this command:

$ premake --clean

To regenerate Makefile use the following commands:
$ premake4 clean
$ premake4 gmake
